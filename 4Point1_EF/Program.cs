            Ensure you have the Microsoft Design and Pomelo MySql packages installed as per the notes on the master branch.
            Throughout this, if you encounter red lines in any file, use Ctrl+. to add the proposed "using" statements.
               
            1) Add new "Models" folder.
            2) Add classes to "Models".
                2a) Add a public partial "ThingContext.cs" class inheriting from DbContext.
                2b) Add public partial column classes.
            3) Set up skeleton context class.
                3a) Create constructors.
                    3a1) Create a empty default constructor.
                    3a2) Create a constructor that acceps a DbContextOptions<THIS_CONTEXT> options, and calls the base constructor.
                3b) Create configuration methods.
                    3b1) Add an OnConfiguring() override that accepts a DbContextOptionsBuilder, if that option builder's "IsConfigured" property is false, declare the connection string for the database.
                    3b2) Add an OnModelCreating override that accepts a ModelBuilder, call OnModelCreatingPartial() at the end.
                    3b3) Add a partial OnModelCreatingPartial override call at the end with no body.
            4) Set up skeleton column classes.
                4a) Declare table name.
                4b) Declare columns (names and types).
                4c) Declare foreign keys (if applicable).
            5) Modify context OnModelCreating to represent the models that you created.
                5a) Add a modelBuild.Entity<MODEL_NAME>() call for each model that will set things like the foreign key mapping and the text encoding.
            6) Add DbSet properties to the context.
            Migrations are used to keep the database in sync with the models. Whenever you change the context or models, a migration will likely be necessary.
            Generate the Migration:
            Run "dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate" in package manager console.
            You should then have a Migrations folder created.
            Push the Migration to the Database:
            Run "dotnet ef database update".
            Assuming no errors, your database should now be there.
            If you make a mistake, you can remove and recreate your model:
            Run "dotnet ef migrations remove".
            To add a subsequent migration:
            Run "dotnet ef migrations add FirstSeedData".
            Run "dotnet ef database update".
            To rollback a migration on the database:
            Run "dotnet ef database update InitialCreate" (or the name of the target).
            Ensure that the database has been rolled back to before the migration to be removed before removing it.
            UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD YOU MODIFY THE Down() METHOD OF A MIGRATION THAT HAS BEEN APPLIED TO THE DATABASE. IF YOU MUST, ROLL IT BACK FIRST.
            Foreign Keys:
            (In the file containing the foreign key)
            -Ensure that the foriegn key property is present (as a normal field)
            -Add a virtual foreign key property to the bottom of the file.
            (In the file the foreign key points to)
            -Add an inverse list virtual foreign key property.
            -Add a constructor that initializes a empty hashset for the virtual property.
            (In the context)
            -Update the context to enforce the constraint.
                -Add the entity.HasX() calls
                -Add the entity.HasIndex() call(s)
